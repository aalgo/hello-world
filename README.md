Markdown tests
--------------

Here there are **tests** of the _markdown_ language:

**NOTE**: These tests are obtained from https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

Here's a code example:

```C++
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```

```bash
$ make
$ make install
```
